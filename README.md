# BlockchainPrinciplesAndPractices
The fundamental data structures and algorithms used to build a typical Blockchain and build up a working example. First, learn how to store single transactions in a block. Second, discover how to store multiple transactions in a block using Merkle trees. Next, learn how to make the Blockchain tamper-proof using mining and proof-of-work. Finally, learn how nodes on a Blockchain maintain consensus. By the end, have the knowledge and tools necessary to build own Blockchain.
